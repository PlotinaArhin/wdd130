    <p> How re you guys faring. Actually let me introduce my self. Im single still searching for a companion after mission. I really love
        music and im in the church choir. I also write stories and music during my free time. </p>
    <p>In my professional life, im a waiter in a restaurant which makes me self reliant.</p>
    <p>One of the things I appreciate most about BYU is the opportunity to combine academic studies with spiritual growth. After each 
        course we have lessons that equip us with moral life and upbringing for us to build our spirit and stay temperate to our heavenly
        father </p>
    <p>I really wanted to be study web design amd i was a little overwhelmed with the course but it seems im loving the course and i know 
        it would better my life and my external family to come.</p>
    <p> I've been a member of this church for 7 years and i love the teachings of the church alot actually my parent are not due to certain 
        untrue believes but as for me i belienve in the teachings and ordinances of the church. </p>
    <p> With togetherness and stewardship i know we would be able to complete the course with good grade and equipped skills</p>
    <p> Thank you all. </p>
